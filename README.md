# 📈 Stock Market Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project performs end-to-end stock market analysis using historical data from **Yahoo Finance**. It answers key financial questions using **Python**, and explores price trends, returns, volatility, and risk using real-world data. The final section includes a basic **LSTM model to predict Apple's closing stock price**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand historical stock trends and movements
- Calculate daily returns and risk (VaR)
- Analyze correlation between major companies
- Predict future prices using deep learning

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**
- **yFinance**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for LSTM model

## 📊 Companies Analyzed

- Apple (AAPL)
- Microsoft (MSFT)
- Google (GOOG)
- Amazon (AMZN)

## 📈 Key Topics Covered

- Stock price visualization
- Daily percentage returns
- Moving averages
- Correlation heatmaps and pair plots
- Value at Risk (Historical VaR method)
- LSTM-based price prediction model

## 🧠 LSTM Forecasting

A basic deep learning model was built using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks to predict Apple’s stock closing prices. This section includes:
- Data scaling and reshaping
- Model architecture with Keras
- Training and testing on time series
- Evaluation and prediction plots

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands)
- Improve LSTM model accuracy and tuning
- Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time interaction
